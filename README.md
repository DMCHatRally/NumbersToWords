YOU NEED TO HAVE PYTHON 3 INSTALLED!

follow the prompts
Otherwise, supply your number after 'numberstowords.py'
like this: python numberstowords.py 1234456789
This program will take any number up to 3000 digits long.
It implements a Roman naming convention to generate names
No, 'GAZILLION' is not a number :), but you'll find some pretty weird and hard-to-pronounce names if you play with this program.
